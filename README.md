# 🐳 Docker Projects Repository

This repository contains my end-to-end Docker-based projects developed while learning and practicing containerization, DevOps workflows, and microservice-style deployments.

Each project focuses on containerizing applications, connecting services, and exploring CI/CD & reverse proxy setups with Docker.
